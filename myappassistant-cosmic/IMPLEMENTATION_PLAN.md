## Key Differences from Next.js Implementation

| Aspect | Next.js | COSMIC Toolkit |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **State Management** | React hooks, Context API | Elm Architecture (State, Messages, Update, View) |
| **UI Components** | JSX, React components | Rust structs with view() methods |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | COSMIC theme system |
| **API Communication** | fetch(), React Query | reqwest with async/await |
| **Routing** | Next.js App Router | Nav bar navigation |
| **Build System** | Webpack, npm | Cargo, just |
| **Performance** | Browser-based | Native code |

## Backend Compatibility

All existing Python/FastAPI endpoints will remain unchanged. The COSMIC application will communicate with the backend using the same API contract as the current Next.js frontend.

## Progress Update (2024-06-24)

### Completed Milestones
1. **Basic GUI Application** - Successfully implemented a working GUI application using Iced
2. **Chat Interface** - Created functional chat interface with message exchange
3. **Custom Styling** - Implemented custom container styling for user and assistant messages
4. **Message Processing** - Added basic message processing with simulated agent responses

### Next Steps
1. Implement proper backend API integration
2. Add additional pages (Dashboard, Pantry, Settings)
3. Implement navigation between pages
4. Add more advanced styling with COSMIC theme system

## Risk Management

1. **Learning curve** - Rust and COSMIC may require time to master
   - Mitigation: Incremental development, focus on one module at a time

2. **API compatibility** - Ensuring all features work with existing backend
   - Mitigation: Thorough testing of each endpoint before proceeding

3. **Performance** - Ensuring native app performs better than web version
   - Mitigation: Regular profiling and optimization

4. **Feature parity** - Maintaining all existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Feature checklist and validation
